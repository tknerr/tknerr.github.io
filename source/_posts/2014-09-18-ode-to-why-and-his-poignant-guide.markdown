If you are learning Ruby you have definitely have to check out ["Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby"](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/), which is probably the most fun to read an introduction to the Ruby programming language ever.

But who is this guy called "_why" and why shoud I read his guide...?

<!-- more -->

## Who the **\*beep\*** is _why?

It's author, [why the lucky stiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff) (or in short "\_why") was as creative mastermind who massively influenced the Ruby community with his works. The community was shocked when he (or rather his online persona "\_why" -- nobody knew his real name) suddenly disappeared back in 2009 and took all of his source code and web sites offline.

His disappearance keeps being a mystery, but his works are still famous and considered "classics" among Rubyists. There is a [backup of all his contributions](http://viewsourcecode.org/why) available (including source code, libraries, writings, music, comics and other artworks) if you are curious.

Also, the smashing magazine published an [insightful article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/15/why-a-tale-of-a-post-modern-genius/) about _why and his works.

> Why the Lucky Stiff (or _Why for short) was one of the brightest and most inspiring programmers in activity. He became famous through a series of blogs and through the incredible amount of open-source projects that he maintained over the course of more than seven years
