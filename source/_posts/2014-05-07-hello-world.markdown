This is the obligatory first post, you know what comes now: 

> **"Hi there Octo-Bloggers around the world!"**


Fair enough. Now: to make this first post actually a litte useful here are the links that led me here:

* How to build [CMS-free Websites](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/) with Github Pages and Jekyll
* How trunk club [moved to Octopress + Prose + Github + Travis CI](http://techblog.trunkclub.com/moving-from-tumblr-to-octopress/)

Further, everything you need to know for taming octo-blogs like these:

* Official [Octopress Docs](http://octopress.org/docs/)
* Octopress Wiki: [3rd Party Plugins](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins)
* The [Jekyll Docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
* Prose Wiki: [Getting Started](https://github.com/prose/prose/wiki/Getting-Started)
