<h2>Who the <strong>*beep*</strong> is _why?</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s author, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">why the lucky stiff</a> (or in short &ldquo;_why&rdquo;) was as creative mastermind who massively influenced the Ruby community with his works. The community was shocked when he (or rather his online persona &ldquo;_why&rdquo; &mdash; nobody knew his real name) suddenly disappeared back in 2009 and took all of his source code and web sites offline.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/poignantguide_whytheluckystiff.jpg"></p>

<p>His disappearance keeps being a mystery, but his works are still famous and considered &ldquo;classics&rdquo; among Rubyists. There is a <a href="http://viewsourcecode.org/why">backup of all his contributions</a> available (including source code, libraries, writings, music, comics and other artworks) if you are curious.</p>

<p>Also, the smashing magazine published an <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/15/why-a-tale-of-a-post-modern-genius/">insightful article</a> about _why and his works.</p>

<blockquote><p>Why the Lucky Stiff (or _Why for short) was one of the brightest and most inspiring programmers in activity. He became famous through a series of blogs and through the incredible amount of open-source projects that he maintained over the course of more than seven years</p>
